**Ignacia Fuentes, Ph.D.**

Researcher at DEBRA-Chile Foundation and Center of Genetics and Genomics-UDD

My research interest is to investigate the genetic basis of an phenotypically and gentically heterogenous disease called Epidermolysis bullosa. To do so, I am planning on using a targeted re-sequencing panel of 38 previously described genes. 
I would like to learn from this course how to manage NGS data in general. Would be nice to get to know available programs to process the data and even better if it is with hands-on examples. I know very little about bioinformatics, I have a molecular biology/genetics background.
