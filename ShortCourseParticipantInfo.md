Not exactly what requested but successful fork and pull request.

"“Thermodynamic miracles... events with odds against so astronomical they're effectively impossible, like oxygen spontaneously becoming gold. I long to observe such a thing.
And yet, in each human coupling, a thousand million sperm vie for a single egg. Multiply those odds by countless generations, against the odds of your ancestors being alive; meeting; siring this precise son; that exact daughter... Until your mother loves a man she has every reason to hate, and of that union, of the thousand million children competing for fertilization, it was you, only you, that emerged. To distill so specific a form from that chaos of improbability, like turning air to gold... that is the crowning unlikelihood. The thermodynamic miracle."

**Houman Younessi, PhD**

Research Professor, University of Connecticut

Would like to learn about the available data and their locations and formats

**Ignacia Fuentes, Ph.D.**

Researcher at DEBRA-Chile Foundation and Center of Genetics and Genomics-UDD

My research interest is to investigate the genetic basis of an phenotypically and gentically heterogenous disease called Epidermolysis bullosa. To do so, I am planning on using a targeted re-sequencing panel of 38 previously described genes. 
I would like to learn from this course how to manage NGS data in general. Would be nice to get to know available programs to process the data and even better if it is with hands-on examples. I know very little about bioinformatics, I have a molecular biology/genetics background.

**Nick Liu, MD**

Urologic Oncology Fellow, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

I would like to have some basic understanding of bioinformatics.  I also would like to learn to use IGV as my project will use these tools!

**Yubo Chai**
Pharmacogenomics lab
Mayo Clinic
Rochester MN 55905

Research interest:   pharmacogenomics of SSRI anti-depression

I would like to know bioinformatics tools, principle of different type data analysis, interpret the results, and the available online tools and its usage.

**Anna Pristoupilova**

PhD at Institute of Inherited Metabolic disorders, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic

Research interest: Determining molecular basis of inherited disease, mainly using bioinformatics analysis of NGS data

I'd like to get update of bioinformatics tools and approaches and also absorb a bit of enthusiasm ;-)
